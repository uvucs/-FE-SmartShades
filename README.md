# -FE-SmartShades

This repository contains all the code for the FrontEnd of the SmartShades Project

Welcome!
Please read the following document to understand the basics of this project.

Overview
This project contains the frontend source code for the Smartshades project. The current tech stack is based on Reac, a JavaScript library. By working on this project you will be able to obtain a better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three technologies work together to display all of the things you can see in the web today.

Methodology
To make development easier, we break down webpages into reusable components. The /src/components directory contains the source code for these reusable components. These components are small enough so they can be reused in a wide variety of scenarios. The /src/components directory is our "Components Library", while the src/app/ directory contains the "Implementations", which is when we actually use these reusable components to create a "View".

We use Bootstrap, but not all of it
If you are familiar with bootstrap you should be able to use most of the classes you already know. Just be aware that this project does not utilize the entire bootstrap collection of classes. Check out the bootstrap styles directory to learn what modules are being used. Hint: We are using utility classes and not the components.

Resources:
Web Development is difficult! Even senior developers don't magically have all the answers. Here is a list of helpful resources for each topic. We have a strong positive bias for Coursera. And we actually recommend the Meta courses for frontend and backend development.
